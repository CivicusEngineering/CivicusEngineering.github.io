        <p>
            Civicus Engineering was hired by Castaic Lake Water Agency (CLWA) to design a new water treatment plant near Castaic Lake. Representing the client was Professor Whipple. The existing water treatment plant at the site, called the Earl Schmidt Filtration Plant, is badly broken down but still functional. CLWA determined that it was much a better alternative to build a new water treatment plant than to repair it. The plant is designed with sustainability in mind. An attempt at Envision and LEED certification will be made. Will be completed in June 2018 for CE431 Water Treatment.

            <br>
            <p>The full design report will be posted here when available.

            Civicus Engineering Structural was hired to determine the loadings of a proposed building. The building contains five floors. We determined the loadings of each floor and roof of the building. Loadings consist of dead/live loads of roof and floor, wind loads, and seismic loads. Completed Summer 2017 for CE 305L Structural Design.

        <h3>Materials Testing</h3>
        <p>
        Cal Poly Pomona has determined the necessary materials for a new building and has hired Civicus Engineering R&D to test the materials for suitability. This project is supplementary to the Proposed Agriculture Building Soil Project. Representing Cal Poly Pomona is a CE 221 Materials Professor. Cal Poly Pomona graciously gave Civicus Engineering space on campus to conduct the materials testing. The Professor supervised the testing. Materials tested were aggregates and portland cement concrete. Completed Summer 2017.

        <p>Civicus Engineering Geotechnical was hired to analyze the soil present at the site. The site is located on campus of Cal Poly Pomona, near the orange orchards at the end of Citrus Lane. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were obtained in order to determine their characteristics. Sieve Analysis, consolidation test, compaction test, hydrometer test, and soil classification were conducted to determine the suitable foundation for the structure. The client was Cal Poly Pomona (CE327L Geotech Lab). Completed Spring 2017.</p>
