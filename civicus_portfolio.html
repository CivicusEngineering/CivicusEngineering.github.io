            <h3>Structural Design</h3>
            <p>
            Civicus Engineering Structural was hired to determine the loadings of a proposed building. The building contains five floors. We need to determine the loadings of each floor and roof of the building. Loadings consist of dead/live loads of roof and floor, wind loads, and seismic loads. Contracted Summer 2017.<!-- Change to past tense when completed -->

            <h3>Materials Testing</h3>
            <p>
           Cal Poly Pomona has determined the necessary materials for a new building and has hired Civicus Engineering R&D to test the materials for suitability. This project is supplementary to the Proposed Agriculture Building Soil Project. Representing Cal Poly Pomona is a CE 221 Materials Professor. Cal Poly Pomona has graciously given Civicus Engineering space to conduct the materials testing. The Professor will supervise the testing. Materials tested were coarse aggregates, concrete, reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), asphalt, asphalt concrete, steel, and timber (wood). Contracted Summer 2017. <!-- Change to past tense when completed -->

        <p>Civicus Engineering Geotechnical was hired to analyze the soil present at the site. The site is located on campus of Cal Poly Pomona, near the orange orchards at the end of Citrus Lane. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were obtained in order to determine their characteristics. Sieve Analysis, consolidation test, compaction test, hydrometer test, and soil classification were conducted to determine the suitable foundation for the structure. The client was Cal Poly Pomona (CE327L Geotech Lab). Completed Winter 2017.</p>

        <h3>Soil Investigation at a Determined Site</h3>

        <p>Civicus Engineering Geotechnical was hired to perform a soil investigation of a determined location. The site was located in near Los Angeles. Disturbed soil samples were taken and were tested via sieve analysis. The client was a geotechnical engineering professor at Cal Poly Pomona (CE325 Geotechnical Engineering 1). Completed Fall 2016.</p>
