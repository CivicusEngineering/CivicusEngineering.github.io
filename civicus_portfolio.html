        <p>Civicus Engineering was hired to analyze the soil present at the site. The site is located on campus of Cal Poly Pomona, near the orange orchards at the end of Citrus Lane. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were obtained in order to determine their characteristics. Sieve Analysis, consolidation test, compaction test, hydrometer test, and soil classification were conducted to determine the suitable foundation for the structure. The client was Cal Poly Pomona (CE327L Geotech Lab). Completed Winter 2017.</p>
