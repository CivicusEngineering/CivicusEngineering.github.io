    <h2 class="aboutus">Who Are We?</h2>

    <p>
    We are a <strong><span style="color: red">(fake)</span></strong> civil engineering and construction company based in Southern California. We provide geotechnical, surveying, structural, and construction services with reusability, sustainability, and biomimicry in mind. We focus on solving problems of the future. 
    </p>   

    <br>

    <h2 class="aboutus">Mission Statement</h2>

    <p>
    In all of our projects, reusability and sustainability are our priority. Reusability and sustainability allows us to reuse materials, providing a limitless supply of resources. Reliance on new resources will be decreased, improving the environment. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="aboutus">Our Origin Story</h2>

    <p>
    This company started in October of 2016. While in a geotechnical engineering class, our current CEO came up with the idea of pretending to be a company for an assigned project. The project was a soil report. Our CEO created a fictional company just to make the project, and other future projects, more interesting. And thus...a company was born.
    </p> 

    <p>
    In the beginning stages of the company, there were many changes to the brand and business model. Originally, the name of the company was Medley Engineering. Phonetically, it didn't sound great...it didn't roll off the tongue so a new name was needed. Civicus, latin for civil, was chosen because it sounded better than medley. The original business model was to only provide geotechnical, surveying, and structural services. In the summer of 2017, the business model had changed. To make the company stand out, reusability, sustainability, and biomimicry philosophies were adopted.
